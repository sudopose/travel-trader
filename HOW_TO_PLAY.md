# Travel Trader - How to Play

Welcome to **Travel Trader**, a co-op trading adventure designed for iPad! You and your partner will travel the world, trade exotic goods, and build a trading empire together.

## Objective
Build your fortune by buying goods at low prices in one city and selling them for a profit in another. Use your earnings to travel farther and unlock new destinations.

## How to Play Together
Though the game is technically one-player, it's designed for co-op engagement:
- **Consultation:** Look at market prices together in your current city.
- **Strategy:** Decide which goods are likely to bring the most profit in another city.
- **Turn-Taking:** One person can handle the current city's trading, and the other can decide where to travel next.
- **Goal Setting:** Work together to save up enough money to unlock new prestigious locations like Beijing or New York.

## Game Mechanics
- **Market:** Each city has different prices for goods like Spices, Silk, Gold, and Tea.
- **Events:** Keep an eye on market events (like harvests or shortages) that dramatically affect prices.
- **Travel:** Each city has a travel cost. Plan your route efficiently!
- **Inventory:** Manage your inventory carefully. You can only carry what you buy.
- **Unlocking Locations:** Start in Istanbul and Mumbai, then unlock Cairo, Venice, and eventually the world!

## Tips for Success
1. **Buy Low, Sell High:** Watch for goods with green prices (good deals) and red prices (high value).
2. **Event Tracking:** If there's a Gold Rush, try to get gold to a high-demand market immediately.
3. **Route Planning:** Some cities are cheaper to travel to than others. Plan your loop accordingly.

Enjoy your journey, Traders!
